    <h1> About the Mentoring Program </h1>
    <h3>PWN Lisbonâ€™s mentoring program  pairs together mentees, PWN members, with mentors that are references in their areas. 
      <br>
      <br>
    The program is designed for three different segments of seniority, from board ready women  to those taking their first steps in their professional career. 
<br>
<br>
    The mentees work with their mentor to set and achieve goals during 8-12 monthly sections. They have the support of a team that accompanies the pair as needed, organizes get-togethers and training workshops, aimed at networking and sharing. 
<br>
<br>
    The program has grown significantly given its results orientation and mentors report that learning is mutual.</h3>
